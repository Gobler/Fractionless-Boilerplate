<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
Please see the documentation for your server environment. If you don't plan to use any server side languages like PHP and plan to use only JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in your sites, then you don't even need any server software. It's a good idea to learn how to work in that environment anyway, however, and would like to encourage you to get started with MAMP or XAMPP.
