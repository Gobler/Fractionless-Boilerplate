# Boilerplate Redux

There are a ton of awesome front end HTML boilerplates out there and it can be tough to choose between them all. So why choose at all? Boilerplate Redux is my version of the perfect HTML5 boilerplate. It's based on a number of different projects all mashed together to suit my workflow. It is a total rewrite of my original boilerplate project (still available if anyone like it better) called HTML5 Bill-erplate.

## Components

Boilerplate Redux uses code from the following projects:

* jQuery Effects Library - Minified and uncompressed dev versions included
* Normalize.css - Not a reset, a baseline to be modified
* 1140 CSS Grid - The heart of our Less-based grid system
* More as we add them...

# Usage

Right now, this is at version 0.0.1. That means there isn't enough to provide a working project. If you'd just like to download the code and make your own modifications, feel free. Otherwise we'll have a run down of how to set yourself up real quick soon.

### Credits

We have to give credit where credit is due. Thanks to all these folks who are by far much smarter and more talented that I.
