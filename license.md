# License

Every good open source project needs a license to be cool and official, right? This is ours. It's simple and to the point. We get the basics of the existing licenses but still don't quite understand the legalese used so here is ours:

## Terms

This software is licensed under the DWYW License.

1. Do whatever you want with this software.
2. Copy, plagiarise, modify, profit from, do whatever!
3. We offer no guarantees. Use at your own risk. If you use it, you can't sue the makers.
4. Be kind and give credit, please.

# Why not a GPL?

We know there are a ton of great licenses for OSS and most people will go with a GPL or Apache or MIT or some other license. We get the gist of those but still don't totally understand the terms. We will never use any variant of the GPL or other RMS supported license as we do not support Richard Stallman. RMS has hurt the FSF more than helped it and we support forking it as others have suggested. RMS's inflamatory comments as of late have really solidified this developer's distaste for the man.

## Taking an opportunity to express a view

We love open source projects, support the idea of free software, and certainly can't deny that Stallman is an amazing programmer and has done some great work. However, it seems RMS is more interested in receiving credit, being applauded for his work, and insulting those who don't strictly adhere to his beliefs than anything else.

The idea behind the FSF is something we support. But there is also room for those who want to make a profit too. The world is not a hippie commune and can't operate that way. We can't just give the source away for all our software. Sometimes we have to close source things to make a living. Programming is not an easy thing to do. It is a skill that takes time to develop and constant practice to keep up with the evolution of the industry. The whole reason RMS started the movement (because of a closed source printer driver he wanted to work on his machine) sounds noble but the company making the driver had to pay its employees and turn a profit to produce more products that others enjoy. It's in the nature of a programmer to give back to the community but at the same time we all have to eat.

Everything in moderation. Free and open source works well but not in all cases and not for everyone. It's great that we have lots of choice because of the FSF movement, but it's also great that we have the iPod, iOS, and other closed source projects too. I love my Linux machine but I'm so grateful for my Mac as well and I doubt much of the innovation happening in the GNU/Linux community would have happened as fast had those large companies not made such amazing products to begin with.

There is a lot of backlash against Linux distros like Ubuntu coming from FOSS purists. If you don't like it, don't use it. The open source community wants the public to adopt Linux and other free software but we sometimes have to bend the rules a little to get the public interested in such projects. We must remember that not everyone is a programmer or even a power user. The public wants support and software that just works and the Apple's of the world are giving it to them. The free software community is coming out with some great alternatives and we're getting very close to the out-of-the-box, it-just-works way things are made by the big guys but we do have a way to go still before my mother is comfortable with Ubuntu (which seems like the absolute best Linux distro for beginners).
